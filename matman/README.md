#Matman - a simple Material Manager

Tired of your colleagues borrowing stuff from you and never returning it? Or are you a busy person who borrows stuff from colleagues and forgets to return it? Or maybe you are a little bit of both at the same time? Or your colleagues?

Or do you want to keep track of your test equipment and refer to it in reports/documents using a short but unique ID?

**Matman is the solution for you!** It's a lightweight django-based webapp.

You can even tie it to your AD through LDAP to allow your employees/colleagues to login with their AD credentials without having to register separately.
